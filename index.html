      <p>Officially recorded as a species in 1821, the clouded leopard is almost as mysterious today as it was nearly 200 years ago.</p>

      <p>Clouded Leopards are named because of the large, blotchy, cloud-like markings on their body, head, legs and tail. There may also be some smaller, solid spots on the head and legs.</p>
      <p>There is the Mainland Clouded Leopard we all know and love. In 2006, the Sunda, or Diardi, clouded leopard was named after scientists conducted some genetic testing.</p>
      <p>Sunda Clouded Leopards are generally darker with smaller cloud markings each enclosing small spots. </p>

   <p>The mainland clouded leopard, that we all know and love, inhabits the dense forests from the foothills of the Himalayas through Northeast India and Bhutan to mainland Southeast Asia into South China.</p>
   <p>The Sunda clouded leopard (Neofelis diardi),  lives in the jungles on the islands of Borneo and Sumatra. </p>
   <h3 class='fun'>FUN FACT: Did you know?</h3>
   <p>Clouded leopards are  excellent swimmers and may have populated small islands off Vietnam and Borneo in this way. </p>

   <p>Do clouded leopards still inhabit Taiwan?</p>
   <p>Declared extinct in 2013 after a years-long project to capture one on camera failed, the predatory cat was reportedly spotted by rangers twice last year in a remote part of Taiwan.</p>

      <h3 class='fun'>FUN FACT: Did you know?</h3>
      <p>Clouded leopards are one of the few animals—and one of only two cat species—that can climb down trees headfirst.</p>
      <p>Due to a different bone structure in their neck, the clouded leopard cannot roar like the larger cats, but also cannot purr because it lacks the fully ossified hyoid bone that allows small cats this ability. Vocalizations include growling, hissing and chuffing.</p>

      <h2 id="subspecies">Subspecies</h2>
      <p>The Sunda clouded leopard actually has two subspecies; the Bornean clouded leopard (N. d. borneensis) and Sumatran clouded leopard (N. d. diardi)</p>
      <p>The Sunda clouded leopard differs in molecular, craniomandibular and dental characteristics from the Bornean clouded leopard. It was recognized as a valid subspecies in 2017. Its fur is darker with a smaller cloud pattern.</p>
      <div><p class='quote'>Dr Andrew Kitchener, Department of Natural Sciences, National Museums Scotland noted “It’s incredible that no one has ever noticed these differences.” </p></div>
      <h3 class="fun">FUN FACT: Did you know?</h3>
      <p>Clouded Leopards are not actually leopards: they are completely separate from the genus that contains lions, tigers, leopards and jaguars.</p>

      <h2 id="threats">Habitat Threats</h2>
      <p>S.P.E.C.I.E.S. is working to not only collect important baseline information on the 2 species of clouded leopards, but also to inform the general public about the clouded leopard. In particular, S.P.E.C.I.E.S. aims to publicize the major threat facing clouded leopards today: oil palm displacement of natural habitats. By donating to projects like Project Neofelis or Cameras4Conservation, people can help support clouded leopard conservation.
